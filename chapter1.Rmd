# My current thoughts

Still feeling excited about this course! It was fun to see in the DataCamp exercises how R differs from Python as a language. I think the timetable for this course could have been more clear - it took some extra effort to figure out the actual deadlines for the exercise submissions and peer-reviews. Anyhow, I expect to learn in this course how to use R for data analysis, which should prove *very* useful in the future.
